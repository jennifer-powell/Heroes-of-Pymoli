Analysis of the Purchases of Heroes of Pymoli
Over all, those who played the game the most ranged 20-24 years old. They also spent more money buying items. Males are more likely to play the game and more likely to purchase items as well.

Also, very opinionated: the cooler the name of the item the more it was bought.
